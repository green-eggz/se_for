# Software Engineering Formative Assignment

This is a very simple program that asks the user to input their name and returns **Hello, [Name]!** The purpose of this program is to practice: 
- Using GitHub for source control 
- Using GitHub Projects for project management 
- Using Github Pages for hosting a web application
- Using Figma for prototyping 
- Learning to create HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and README files 

---

## Programs/Languages Used
- HTML: For structuring the app
- CSS: For styling the app
- JavaScript: For interactivity
- Figma: For creating the prototype
- GitHub Projects: For managing the project 
- GitHub Pages: For hosting the app

## Project Management

For this project, I used the GitHub Projects feature to create a Kanban board with tickets. This helped me keep track of my work and complete each step in a logical manner. 

Below is a screenshot of the Kanban midway through the programming process:

## Testing

For testing, I used Figma to create a prototype and constantly referred back to it to ensure that my design matched the intended structure and functionality. 

I also used the website [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to design the colour palette for my app.

Below is a screenshot of the Figma prototype:
